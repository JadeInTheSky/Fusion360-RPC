# Fusion360-RPC
Very simple discord rich presence add-in for Fusion360

# How to install
1. clone this repo & extract the files somewhere
2. open Fusion360 (duh)
3. open the add-ins panel (utilities -> add-ins -> script and add-ins)
4. select the add-ins section and press to add a new add-in (green cross) and select the folder with the cloned repo
5. Run it (it will autostart every time you launch Fusion360)
6. now you should have your discord rich presence stating that you're playing Fusion360 (you must have discord open for it to work, obviously)
